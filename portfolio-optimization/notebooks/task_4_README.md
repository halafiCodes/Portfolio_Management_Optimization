# Task 4 — Optimize Portfolio Based on Forecast

## Objective
Use TSLA forecasted returns and historical BND/SPY returns to construct an optimal portfolio using Modern Portfolio Theory.

## Notebook
- notebooks/task_4.ipynb

## Key Steps
- Build expected returns vector (TSLA forecast + historical BND/SPY)
- Compute annualized covariance matrix
- Generate efficient frontier
- Identify max‑Sharpe and min‑volatility portfolios
- Recommend an optimal portfolio

## Outputs
- Efficient frontier plot with key portfolios
- Covariance heatmap
- Recommended weights and portfolio metrics

## How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells from top to bottom.
